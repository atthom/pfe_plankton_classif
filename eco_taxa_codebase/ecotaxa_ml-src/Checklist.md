# Done

- [x] Retrain `SCN_zoocam_group1_1_2017-08-22-03-34/`
- [x] Feature dump needs to contain image identificators
- [x] RF on Zooscan
- [x] Dump features in new format, also for test set
- [x] SCN: Predict testing set (ob...)
- [x] SCN: Implement reading the dataset from a text file (...)
- [x] RF: Visualize results
- [x] RF on SCN features for all datasets
- [x] RF on SCN+Zooprocess features for all datasets
- [x] Use best settings to predict test set and extract actual test set performance, for every instrument and model (RF, SCN, RF+SCN). Save models along the way.
- [x] Code a version of wp2.cpp that can be used for training or feature computation, with a simple toggle if possible.
- [x] Document SCN
- [x] Create folders for the SCN models to be imported in EcoTaxa.
- [x] Finish training the various RF models and store all the data in the appropriate repo
- [x] Write readme
- [x] Transfer features
- [x] Upload SCN models to niko (Needs number of components)
- [x] Prepare some RF models for use on niko
- [x] Move dataset creation to script and document

# Failed
